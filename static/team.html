                         <br>
						 <p style="text-align: center">Electrical Distribution Systems Designer working on Feeder Hardening projects on behalf of FPL at PGA, Florida. He will receive his B.S. in Electrical Engineering at Florida Atlantic University this upcoming December and expects to become an Engineer in Training upon completing the FE exam this upcoming year. Throughout his academic career, he has specialized in Electrical Power Systems, undertaking power systems and machines related course load and becoming part of IEEE Power and Energy Society. Mr. Llerena commonly enjoys field work as much as he enjoys rigorous courses and learning sessions. His electrical experience includes work as an Electrical Apprentice where he was in charge with installation and maintenance of various electrical power systems including electrical panels, generators, wiring and lighting.
                        Mr. Llerena also possesses experience in permitting utility work and equipment in Right of Way as required by the design and installation of Electrical Distribution Systems. Part of his permit work includes FDOT and City of West Palm Beach permitting for Hillcrest Feeder, the distribution feeder responsible for powering Mar-a-Lago. He also enjoys first respondent work, as observed during the 2017 Hurricane Irma where he participated in FPL Storm Duty performing Feeder and Lateral Patrols. Mr. Llerena hopes to advance his career and understanding in electrical power systems.

Mr. Carvalho emigrated from his home country of Brazil in 2001, where he first entered ESOL the same year to master English as a second language. Soon after, Mr. Carvalho graduated with an Associates in Arts from Palm Beach State College and entered Florida Atlantic University as an undergraduate student in Electrical Engineering, where he has been recognized numerous times for his academic achievements through honors and awards. Mr. Carvalho will graduate with his bachelor’s this upcoming December and plans to pass the FE soon after to become an Engineer in Training. Throughout his time in the USA, Mr. Carvalho has been able to excel his career, become a naturalized US Citizen and find happiness in his personal life. He enjoys spending time with his wife as much as designing high voltage electrical systems.
                       As an Electrical Distribution Systems Designer, Mr. Carvalho has been engaged in the design and permitting of various distribution systems. He was responsible for completing FAA, FDOT, FEC and City of West Palm Beach permits as part of the Hillcrest Feeder project, involving the distribution system feeding the President’s home at Mar-a-Lago.

						 <p style="text-align: center">I am a Computer Engineer graduating in fall 2017 from Florida Atlantic University with a high interest in computer science. Over the summer I took part in a REU (Research Experience for Undergraduates) at FIU and underwent research in cybersecurity with primary focus on the security of Blockchains. During the REU I was able to publish a paper to IEEE on the Cybergrenade framework, a single script used to exploit machines on a local network using Python, and I am scheduled to speak at the conference in October 2017. For my Senior Design Project, I am working with a group of two EE, and one CS majors to design a smart power panel with Raspberry Pi, and Arduino microprocessors, I will be responsible for programming in Python (single script), Arduino, and developing the database, and webpage for both mobile and web
